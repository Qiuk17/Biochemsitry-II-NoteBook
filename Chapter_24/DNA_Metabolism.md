# Chapter 24 DNA Metabolism
## Replication
- Semiconservative
  - each strand acts as a template.
  - proved by experiment using E.*coli* cells. ([The experiment.](images/semi_exp.jpg))
  - daughter strands are synthesized **immediately** after parental strands separate. ([No complete unwinding DNA strands observed.](images/replication.jpg))
- DNA replication begins at **specific** sites and proceeds **bidirectionally**.
- The chemistry of DNA polymerizarion
  - revealed by *in vitro*(体外的) studies using DNA polymerase purified from E.*coli*
  - pol I(in E.*coli*) catalyze DNA polymerization *in vitro* in presence of a single strand DNA (**template**), a preexisting **primer** with a free 3'-OH group, and **dNTP**s.
  - [Elogation of DNA chain, using pol I. Pol I binds to DNA.](images/elongation.jpg)
  - The fundamental reaction: 3'-OH group of the growing strand attacks the 5'-$\alpha$-phosphorus of dNTPs. **So, the synthesized DNA is always extended in the 5'->3' direction.**
- DNA pol I
  - DNA polymerase I has three enzymatic activities in **a single polypeptide chain**, which can be cleaved into two functional parts by mild protease treatment:
    - smaller one: 5'->3' exonuclease activity.
    - larger one (aka. Klenow fragment): 3'->5' exonuclease activity and polymerase activity.
  - [**Proofreading**](images/proofread.jpg): The 3'->5' exonuclease activityoes is found to be able to remove mismatched base pairs, thus to proofread the newly incorporated nucleotides. And this activity is highly specific for mismatched base pairs.
  - [**Nick translation**](images/nickTranslation.jpg): The 5'->3' exonuclease activity allows pol I to degrade and replace an RNA or DNA strand paired to a DNA template simultaneously. Used in:
    - DNA repair
    - Removal of RNA primers in DNA replication
  - The velocity of this enzyme is low (600 necleotides/min), and its processivity (持续合成能力) is also low (about 50 nucleotides). So, E.*coli* cells don't use this for DNA replication.
- [DNA pol III](images/polIII.jpg)
  - Multimeric, containing at least 10 different subunits.
  - The holoenzyme exists as an asymmetric (不对称的) dimer, which is believed to be responsble for synthesizing the leading strand and the lagging strand.
  - Polymerization activity is on $\beta$ subunits.
  - Proofreading activity is on $\epsilon$ subunits.
  - $\beta$ subunits provide high processivity (more than 500,000 nucleotides per binding).
  - The rate of DNA synthesis is high (1,000 nucleotides pre second).
  - No 5'->3' exonuclease activity. So, it cannot remove the RNA primers.
  - Functions of each subunits: <br />
    | Subunit | Function |
    | :--: | :-- |
    | $\alpha$ | Polymerization |
    | $\epsilon$ | 3'->5' Proofreading exonuclease |
    | $\theta$ | Stabilization of $\epsilon$ subunit |
    | $\tau$ | Stable template binding; core enzyme dimerization |
    | $\gamma$ | Clamp loader |
    | $\delta$ | Clamp opener |
    | $\delta '$ | Clamp loader |
    | $\beta$ | DNA clamp required for optimal processivity |
    | | |
  - The $\alpha, \beta$ and $\theta$ subunits are **core polymerase**.
  - The $\tau, \gamma, \delta$ and $\delta '$ subunits are called **Clamp-loading ($\gamma$) comlpex** that loads $\beta$ subunits on *lagging strand* at each Okazaki fragment.
- [Comparison of DNA polymerases of E.*coli*.](images/comparison&#32;of&#32;pols.jpg)
- Overview on DNA replication of E.*coli*:
  - **Helicase** (*dnaB*): moving along the DNA and separating the two DNA strands *using energy* from ATP;
  - **Topoisomerase** (拓扑异构酶): relieving topological strains in the helical structure (positive supercoils) generated during strand seperation;
  - **DNA-binding protein**: binding and stabilizing the single-stranded DNA generated;
  - **Primase** (*dnaG*): generating a short RNA primer;
  - **DNA polymerase III**: polymerizing and proofreading the nucleotides according to the templates;
  - **DNA polymerase I** (*pol A*): removing the RNA primers and replacing by a DNA sequence;
  - **DNA ligase**: sealing nicks between the Okazaki fragments.
- **Semidiscontinuous** synthesis of the two daughter DNA strands.
  - At a [replication fork](images/replicationFork.jpg), the overall elongation direction for one daughter strand is 5'->3' and 3'->5' due to the **antiparallel** features of DNA deplexes.
    - The 5'->3' (**leading strand**) is synthesized continuously.
    - The 3'->5' (**lagging strand**) is synthesized in small fragments (called *Okazaki fragments*). The fragments are then joined by **NDA ligase**s. The fragments are synthesized in 5'->3'.

## Degration
- DNA is degraded by nucleases (DNases)
  - **Exonucleases (外切酶)** degrade nucleic acids from one end of the molecule. Operate in only 5'->3' **or** 3'->5' direction, removing nucleotides **only** from the 5' or 3' end.
  - **Endonucleases (内切酶)** can begin to degrade at any sites in a nucleic acid strand or molecule. Reduce it to smaller and smaller fragments.
