# Chapter 24 DNA Metabolism
## Replication
- Semiconservative
  - each strand acts as a template.
  - proved by experiment using E.*coli* cells. ([The experiment.](images/semi_exp.jpg))
- daughter strands are synthesized **immediately** after parental strands separate. ([No complete unwinding DNA strands observed.](images/replication.jpg))
- DNA replication begins at **specific** sites and proceeds **bidirectionally**.
- The chemistry of DNA polymerizarion
  - revealed by *in vitro*(体外的) studies using DNA polymerase purified from E.*coli*
  - pol I(in E.*coli*) catalyze DNA polymerization *in vitro* in presence of a single strand DNA (**template**), a preexisting **primer** with a free 3'-OH group, and **dNTP**s.
  - [Elogation of DNA chain, using pol I. Pol I binds to DNA.](images/elongation.jpg)
  - The fundamental reaction: 3'-OH group of the growing strand attacks the 5'-$\alpha$-phosphorus of dNTPs. **So, the synthesized DNA is always extended in the 5'->3' direction.**
- DNA pol I
  - DNA polymerase I has three enzymatic activities in **a single polypeptide chain**, which can be cleaved into two functional parts by mild protease treatment:
    - smaller one: 5'->3' exonuclease activity.
    - larger one (aka. Klenow fragment): 3'->5' exonuclease activity and polymerase activity.
  - [**Proofreading**](images/proofread.jpg): The 3'->5' exonuclease activityoes is found to be able to remove mismatched base pairs, thus to proofread the newly incorporated nucleotides. And this activity is highly specific for mismatched base pairs.
  - [**Nick translation**](images/nickTranslation.jpg): The 5'->3' exonuclease activity allows pol I to degrade and replace an RNA or DNA strand paired to a DNA template simultaneously. Used in:
    - DNA repair
    - Removal of RNA primers in DNA replication
- **Semidiscontinuous** synthesis of the two daughter DNA strands.
  - At a [replication fork](images/replicationFork.jpg), the overall elongation direction for one daughter strand is 5'->3' and 3'->5' due to the **antiparallel** features of DNA deplexes.

## Degration
- DNA is degraded by nucleases (DNases)
  - **Exonucleases (外切酶)** degrade nucleic acids from one end of the molecule. Operate in only 5'->3' **or** 3'->5' direction, removing nucleotides **only** from the 5' or 3' end.
  - **Endonucleases (内切酶)** can begin to degrade at any sites in a nucleic acid strand or molecule. Reduce it to smaller and smaller fragments.
